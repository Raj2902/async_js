I HAVE COMPLETED ALL THE TASK AS PER THE ASSIGNMENT.
THINGS TO NOTE:
1) THE LOADING IN PROMISE AND ASYNC AWAIT TASK WAS FAST THAN 5 SEC SO IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO SEE VISUALLY IF I
IMPLEMENTED IT USE A SETTIMEOUT TO TEST IT, I HAVE ALREAD TESTED IT IT ALL WORKS FINE.
2) I HAVE USED RESPONSE.OK ALSO TO CHECK THE STATUS CODE OF THE API IF OK THEN EXECUTE OTHERWISE REJECT SO PLEASE DONT GET 
CONFUSED ON THAT.
3) I HAVE TRIED TO MIMIC THE RESULT AND LOOK AS IN THE ASSIGNMENT PROVIDED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.
4) AS PER ASSIGNMENT RESPONSIVNESS CAN BE LEFT BEHIND.
5) I HAVE USED INTERNAL CSS AND JS AS THE ASSIGNMENT WAS MORE FOCUSED ON CONCEPT THAN ON FILE STRUCTING
